# Data Structures Journey with Abhijit Kad

Hello there! My name is Abhijit Kad, and this repository documents my journey learning data structures. Here, you'll find all of my code implementations based on the subject of data structures, all written in the C programming language.

## About

This repository serves as a collection of my coding projects and exercises related to data structures and algorithms. Each folder contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C.

## Contents

1. **Data Structures:**
   - `Linked Lists`: Implementations of linked lists.
   - `Stacks and Queues`: Implementations of stacks and queues.
   - `Trees`: Implementations of tree data structures (binary trees, binary search trees, etc.).
   - `Hash Tables`: Implementations of hash tables.
   - `Other Data Structures`: Implementations of additional data structures.

2. **Algorithms:**
   - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.)
   - Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search, etc.)
   - Dynamic programming
   - Greedy algorithms
   - Divide and conquer algorithms
   - Other algorithm implementations

## About Me

I am passionate about learning and mastering data structures and algorithms, and this repository reflects my dedication to this subject. By sharing my code implementations, I hope to contribute to the learning journey of others interested in data structures and algorithms.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
